    <h1>Superclass: Helix-turn-helix domains</h1>
    <p>TFs of the HTH domains superclass bind specific DNA sequences by inserting a ‘recognition’ alpha-helix into the major groove. 
	This recognition helix is followed by a turn and, in most cases, two additional alpha-helices packed nearly perpendicularly against it. 
	HTH DBDs also often have an additional structure (usually a loop) that projects basic residues in the DNA minor groove, also contributing 
	to the sequence specificity. 
	<br>
	TFClass divides the HTH domains superclass into seven classes, five of which are present in plants: 
	Heat shock factors, Fork head/winged helix factors, AT-rich interaction domain (ARID), Homeo domain factors (HD), and Tryptophan cluster factors.</p>

	<h2>Class: Homeo domain factors </h2>
	<p> As for the HD TF, their variety in plants comes from the diversity of adjacent domains, 
	including a leucine zipper in HD-Zip that affects DNA binding by allowing dimerization [16]. 
	3D structures of plant HD DBDs are available for WUSCHEL (WOX family) (6RYI) and revealed a 
	canonical HD fold with loop regions connecting the three alpha-helices that are expanded 
	compared with the Engrailed HD protein of Drosophila melanogaster [17].
