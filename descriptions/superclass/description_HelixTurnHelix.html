    <h1>Superclass: Helix-turn-helix domains</h1>
    <p>TFs of the HTH domains superclass bind specific DNA sequences by inserting a ‘recognition’ alpha-helix into the major groove. 
	This recognition helix is followed by a turn and, in most cases, two additional alpha-helices packed nearly perpendicularly against it. 
	HTH DBDs also often have an additional structure (usually a loop) that projects basic residues in the DNA minor groove, also contributing 
	to the sequence specificity. 
	<br>
	TFClass divides the HTH domains superclass into seven classes, five of which are present in plants: 
	Heat shock factors, Fork head/winged helix factors, AT-rich interaction domain (ARID), Homeo domain factors (HD), and Tryptophan cluster factors.</p>
