    <h1>Superclass: Helix-turn-helix domains</h1>
    <p>TFs of the HTH domains superclass bind specific DNA sequences by inserting a ‘recognition’ alpha-helix into the major groove. 
	This recognition helix is followed by a turn and, in most cases, two additional alpha-helices packed nearly perpendicularly against it. 
	HTH DBDs also often have an additional structure (usually a loop) that projects basic residues in the DNA minor groove, also contributing 
	to the sequence specificity. 
	<br>
	TFClass divides the HTH domains superclass into seven classes, five of which are present in plants: 
	Heat shock factors, Fork head/winged helix factors, AT-rich interaction domain (ARID), Homeo domain factors (HD), and Tryptophan cluster factors.</p>

	<h2>Class: Tryptophan cluster factors </h2>
	<p> The Tryptophan cluster factors class contains MYB and MYB-related TF families 
	that are represented by few members in mammals but are greatly expanded in land plants 
	(as R2R3-MYB, MYB genes containing two repeats of the MYB-type HTH domain) to form one of 
	the largest TF families [18]. A structure of plant MYB DBD in complex with DNA is 
	available for the R2R3-MYB WEREWOLF (6KKS) and revealed a fold similar to that of other 
	eukaryotic MYBs [19].	We have added to the Tryptophan cluster factors class three plant 
	families absent in mammals: the GARP, the Trihelix, and the Storekeeper (STK) TFs (also 
	known as GeBP). GARP TFs have a DBD sharing weak sequence similarity with MYB due to a 
	common ancestry. These TFs come in two subfamilies, G2-like and ARR-B, with structures 
	available in complex with DNA for the G2-like TFs PHR1 (6J4R) [20] and LUX (5LXU) [21], 
	and without DNA for the ARR-B TF ARR10 (1IRZ) [22]. 
	<br>
	The Trihelix motif was initially
	proposed to be evolutionarily related to the C-MYB DBD based on weak sequence similarity 
	[23], and this hypothesis was later confirmed by a solution structure of arabidopsis GT-1 
	DBD (2JMW) [24]. STK TFs were included in this class based on the AlphaFold2 model of 
	their DBD; this model shows similarity with HTH domains, and 3D structure comparisons
	return good alignments with members of the Trihelix family, MYB family, and GARP/G2-like 
	subfamily [with root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 3 Å on 80 equivalent positions out 
	of 90 residues]. All these families harbor conserved tryptophan residues (three for 
	R2R3-MYB WEREWOLF and STK down to one for GARP)
	within the HTH domain, justifying their inclusion in this class. </p>
